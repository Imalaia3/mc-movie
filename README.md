### Minecraft Movie

This was a very rushed project. Someone challenged me to make a movie in minecraft so I did it.

# Features

-Play on all maps at the same time

-Server Updates can be triggered manually

- Video Server

- Video Player

# Usage
Minecraft Player

1. Run `server.py`.
2. Then, if no errors appear, run your server with the compiled plugin inside your `plugins` folder.
3. After that, create a redstone loop with 2 `redstone repeaters` so you can control the timings. Then Chain 2 `command blocks`. The First one must contain the `/tickframe` command and the second one the `/tickserver` command.
4. Lastly, Get an empty map, start the redstone clock and right click the map. Have fun 👋!
